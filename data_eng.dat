[Job_Descrip]
Janitor=Clean up your act and clean up our floors whilst you’re at it! I want you to make those floors, the foundations of YOUR reform, look their best.#Collect a mop or broom from the janitor office and use it to remove patches of dirt you find around the prison.

Laundry=Your criminal attitude stinks, and so do your overalls! The only thing I want to smell on you inmates is the fresh scent of justice.#Take dirty outfits from the container in the laundry room and place them into the washers. Once spun, take them out and put them into the clean laundry container.

Kitchen=The inspectors call it hazardous, I call it ‘Rustic’. A sense of taste andor smell is not essential. Don’t worry about washing your hands.#Take uncooked food from the freezer in the kitchen and place them in the ovens. Once cooked, take them out and put them on the serving trays in the canteen.

Woodshop=Responsibly sourced by us, irresponsibly hammered together by you lot. Our wood shop has found quite the market for our ‘vintage inspired’ furniture. No craftsmanship required, the prison is NOT responsible for splinters.#Take three timbers from the container in the woodshop and craft them into furniture. Place the finished product in the furniture container.

Library=You lot accuse the library of being understocked, but I assure you it’s a ‘modest’ collection of the finest literary works available. Not the inane jumble of expletives and filth you rabble are used to on the outside.#Collect books from the library and deliver them to the inmates they’re addressed to. You can either give it to them personally or leave it ON (not in) their cell desk.

Tailor=As a prison, we are proud of our contract with famous clothing brand ‘Adidoodoo’ and are determined to meet their need for high quality, hand crafted garments.#Take three pieces of fabric from the container in the tailorshop and craft them into an item of clothing. Place the finished product in the clothing container.

Gardening=Dream of working in the great outdoors Being at one with nature and all that Then introduce yourself to the weeds plaguing our courtyards.#Collect a hoe from the gardening office and use it to remove weeds around the prison grounds.

Mailman=I hate to be the bearer of bad news, which is why I’m asking you to do it for me.#Collect mail from the mailroom and deliver it to the inmates it’s addressed to. You can either give it to them personally or leave it ON (not in) their cell desk.

Metalshop=The automotive industry is booming! The only booming you will hear is the sound of licence plates being pressed. The harder you work, the sooner I get my sporty little convertible.#Take metal sheets from the container in the metalshop and use them on the presses to create license plates. Put the finished plates in the relevant container.

Deliveries=What’s inside those boxes isn’t of concern to you. I just want them moving UNTAMPERED to where they need to go. #Take packages from the delivery truck and place them in the relevant storage containers.
