Just follow these three easy steps to make custom text files for yourself in The Escapists;

1. Make a copy of 'speech_eng.dat' file and rename it
2. Edit the contents of the new file how you wish
3. In the game settings, set up the CUSTOM SPEECH field with your new file name

NOTES: 
- Don't edit the original speech file or the game won't let you in
- The speech in each group must follow in numerical order
